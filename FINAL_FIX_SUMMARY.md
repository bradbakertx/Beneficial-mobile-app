# Final Fix Summary - Expo Mobile Preview Issues

## Problems Encountered

### Problem 1: "Something went wrong" Error
**Error**: Mobile preview showing "Something went wrong" when trying to load
**Root Cause**: CORS configuration blocking requests from `https://app.emergent.sh`
**Solution**: Added CORS whitelist to `/app/frontend/app.json`

### Problem 2: "java.io.IOException: Failed to download remote update" Fatal Error
**Error**: Mobile device unable to download the app bundle from Expo
**Root Cause**: URL mismatch - `EXPO_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME` was set to `https://beneficial-mobile.preview.emergentagent.com` but the actual ngrok tunnel was at `inspectapp.ngrok.io`. This caused the manifest to point to the wrong URLs.
**Solution**: Removed `EXPO_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME` from `/app/frontend/.env` to let Expo automatically use the correct ngrok tunnel URL

## Files Modified

### 1. `/app/frontend/app.json`
Added CORS configuration:
```json
"web": {
  "cors": {
    "origin": ["https://app.emergent.sh", "https://*.emergent.sh", "*"]
  }
}
```

### 2. `/app/frontend/.env`
Removed the line:
```
EXPO_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=https://beneficial-mobile.preview.emergentagent.com
```

### 3. `/app/frontend/app/inspections/agreement.tsx`
**Signature Pad Fixes** (from Phase 1):
- Changed from `useState` to `useRef` for stable inspectionId storage
- Added `useCallback` with `setTimeout` for batched state updates
- Replaced HTML `<img>` tag with React Native `<Image>` component
- Added `Image` import from react-native

### 4. `/app/frontend/components/SignaturePad.tsx`
**Signature Pad Fixes** (from Phase 1):
- Added guards to prevent duplicate signature callbacks
- Check if signature already captured before processing

## Verification

✅ **CORS Errors**: No longer appearing in logs
✅ **Android Bundle**: Successfully building (1956 modules bundled)
✅ **Expo Service**: Running stable (pid 5446)
✅ **Backend**: Running properly with 200 OK responses
✅ **Tunnel**: Working correctly with ngrok

## Expected Behavior

The mobile preview should now:
1. Load without "Something went wrong" error
2. Download the app bundle successfully from ngrok tunnel
3. Display the app correctly on mobile devices
4. Handle signature pad interactions without crashes

## Testing Instructions

1. Scan the Expo QR code with your mobile device
2. The app should download and load successfully
3. Navigate to an inspection agreement screen
4. Test the signature pad:
   - Click "Sign Agreement"
   - Draw a signature
   - Click "Done"
   - Verify signature appears and screen doesn't crash
   - Click "Submit Signed Agreement"
   - Verify navigation to agent-info screen

## Technical Notes

- The ngrok tunnel at `inspectapp.ngrok.io` is the correct URL for mobile access
- The `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` remains pointing to `https://beneficial-mobile.preview.emergentagent.com` for API calls (this is correct)
- The CORS configuration allows the Emergent platform UI to access the Expo dev server
- Signature pad now uses proper React Native components throughout

## Status

**RESOLVED** - All blocking issues for mobile preview have been addressed. The app should now load and function correctly on mobile devices.
