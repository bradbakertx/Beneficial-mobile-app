## üîí Compliance Features Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ User Consent Management

**Database Fields Added (UserInDB model):**
```python
terms_accepted: bool = False                    # Terms of Service acceptance
terms_accepted_at: Optional[datetime] = None    # Timestamp of acceptance
privacy_policy_accepted: bool = False           # Privacy Policy acceptance
privacy_policy_accepted_at: Optional[datetime] = None
marketing_consent: bool = False                 # Optional marketing emails
data_processing_consent: bool = False           # GDPR data processing
ip_address_at_registration: Optional[str] = None  # Audit trail
```

**Registration Enforcement:**
- Users CANNOT register without accepting Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- Backend validates consent before creating accounts
- Timestamps are automatically recorded for audit compliance
- Consent is permanently stored with user UUID

### 2. ‚úÖ What Consent is Required

**MANDATORY (Cannot register without these):**
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Terms of Service**: Legal agreement for app usage
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Privacy Policy**: How data is collected, used, and protected

**OPTIONAL:**
- ‚òê **Marketing Communications**: Newsletter, promotional emails

**AUTOMATIC:**

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Endpoints to Add

### 1. Data Export Endpoint:
```python
@api_router.get("/users/export-data")
async def export_user_data(current_user: UserInDB = Depends(get_current_user_from_token)):
    """
    Export all user data in JSON format (GDPR Article 20)
    Returns: User profile, quotes, inspections, messages, etc.
    """
    pass
```

### 2. Account Deletion Endpoint:
```python
@api_router.delete("/users/delete-account")
async def delete_user_account(current_user: UserInDB = Depends(get_current_user_from_token)):
    """
    Permanently delete user account and all associated data (GDPR Article 17)
    - Delete user profile
    - Anonymize or delete messages
    - Delete quotes and inspections
    - Delete files from S3
    - Send confirmation email
    """
    pass
```

### 3. Consent Update Endpoint:
```python
@api_router.patch("/users/consent")
async def update_consent(
    consent_data: ConsentUpdate,
    current_user: UserInDB = Depends(get_current_user_from_token)
):
    """
    Update user consent preferences (marketing, etc.)
    """
    pass
```

## üìß Required User Communications

### 1. **Welcome Email** (After Registration):
- Confirm registration

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Considerations

### 1. **Privacy Policy Accessibility**:
- Must be easily accessible from registration screen
- Should be available in app menu
- Clear, plain language (not just legal jargon)
- Include last updated date

### 2. **Data Retention**:
Define how long you keep data:
- Active users: Duration of account
- Inactive users: Consider deletion after X years
- Deleted accounts: Anonymize or purge after 30-90 days
- Backup retention: Balance security with privacy

### 3. **Children's Privacy (COPPA)**:
- If your app is not for children under 13, state this in terms
- Do not knowingly collect data from children under 13

### 4. **International Data Transfers**:
- If using AWS S3 or servers outside user's country
- GDPR requires adequate safeguards for EU data leaving EU
- Consider data residency requirements

## üéØ Action Items for Production

### HIGH PRIORITY:
1. **Create comprehensive Privacy Policy**
2. **Update Terms of Service**
3. **Update frontend registration** to include consent checkboxes

5. **Add Privacy Policy & Terms links** to app footer

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:
6. **Implement data export endpoint**
7. **Implement account deletion endpoint**
8. **Add "Contact Us" for privacy requests**
9. **Create data retention policy**

### LOW PRIORITY (but important):
10. **Set up privacy request tracking system**

12. **Regular compliance audits**
13. **Cookie policy** (if applicable)
