# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: Redesign Agent workflow for "Request a Quote". Agents should only fill out Property Information and Additional section. Agent quotes should appear on Owner's Pending Quotes list as orange cards. After Agent accepts quote and selects time slot, a form should open to enter Client (Customer) information. When Customer logs in, Pre-Inspection Agreement should automatically open for signature.

PHASE 2 - Updated QuoteInDB model with is_agent_quote, agent_name, agent_email, agent_phone fields. Modified POST /quotes to allow agents, marking agent quotes with is_agent_quote=true. Updated GET /quotes to allow agents to view their quotes. PHASE 3 - Updated pending quotes screen to display agent quotes with orange background, border, briefcase icon, and AGENT badge. PHASE 4 - Created PATCH /inspections/{id}/client-info endpoint for agents to add client info. Updated POST /inspections/schedule to allow agents. Created agent-client-info.tsx screen for entering client details. Modified select-time.tsx to navigate agents to client info form after time confirmation. Agents now enter client name, email, phone and an invitation email is sent to client to login/register. PHASE 5 - Existing functionality: When customer with matching email logs in and navigates to Active Inspections, agreement auto-opens (already implemented).
