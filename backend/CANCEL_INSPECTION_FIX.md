# Owner Cancel Inspection Fix - Summary

## Issue Reported
When the owner clicks "Cancel Inspection" button on the Active Inspections screen, nothing happens. The expected behavior is:
1. Show confirmation dialog asking if user is sure
2. If confirmed, delete the inspection from the app
3. Send calendar cancellation emails to:
   - Customer
   - Owner
   - Inspector (if different from owner)

## Root Cause Analysis
The frontend already had:
- ✅ Confirmation dialog implemented
- ✅ Proper API call to DELETE /api/admin/inspections/{inspection_id}/cancel

The backend endpoint existed but was missing inspector cancellation logic:
- ✅ Sent cancellation to customer
- ✅ Sent cancellation to owner
- ✅ Sent cancellation to agent (if applicable)
- ❌ **Missing**: Inspector cancellation (when inspector is different from owner)

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (`/app/backend/server.py`)

Enhanced the `DELETE /admin/inspections/{inspection_id}/cancel` endpoint with:

1. **Inspector Email Mapping**
   ```python
   inspector_emails = {
       "Brad Baker": "bradbakertx@gmail.com",
       "Blake Gray": None  # TODO: Add Blake's email when available
   }
   ```

2. **Inspector Calendar Cancellation**
   - Retrieves inspector email from mapping based on `inspector_name`
   - Only sends if inspector email exists and is different from owner/customer
   - Prevents duplicate emails using `emails_sent` set

3. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Tracks all emails sent in `emails_sent` set
   - Converts emails to lowercase for comparison
   - Skips sending if email already received cancellation

4. **Comprehensive Tracking**
   - Returns list of all emails that received cancellations
   - Includes customer, owner, inspector, and agent (if applicable)

### Key Features Added

**Email Deduplication Logic:**
```python
emails_sent = set()  # Track all emails to prevent duplicates

# For each recipient (customer, owner, inspector, agent):
if recipient_email.lower() not in emails_sent:
    send_inspection_calendar_cancellation(...)
    emails_sent.add(recipient_email.lower())
```

**Inspector Detection:**
- Maps inspector name to email address
- Only sends if inspector is different from owner
- Logs all cancellations for debugging

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Inspection cancelled successfully. Calendar cancellations have been sent.",
  "calendar_cancellations_sent": {
    "customer": "customer@example.com",
    "owner": "owner@example.com",
    "inspector": "inspector@example.com",
    "agent": "agent@example.com"  // if applicable
  }
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Via Mobile App (Owner Role)
1. Login as owner (bradbakertx@gmail.com / Beneficial1!)
2. Navigate to Dashboard → Active Inspections
3. Find an inspection card
4. Tap "Cancel Inspection" button
5. Verify confirmation dialog appears
6. Confirm cancellation
7. Verify:
   - Inspection disappears from list
   - Success message appears
   - Check email for calendar cancellations

### Expected Behavior
**Confirmation Dialog:**
- Should show property address
- Should mention calendar notifications will be sent
- Should have "No, Keep It" and "Yes, Cancel" options

**After Confirmation:**
- Inspection removed from Active Inspections list
- Success alert/message shown
- Calendar cancellation emails sent to:
  - Customer email
  - Owner email (bradbakertx@gmail.com)
  - Inspector email (if inspector is Brad Baker and owner is someone else, or vice versa)
  - Agent email (if agent is associated with inspection)

**Calendar Cancellations:**
- Each recipient gets .ics file with CANCEL status
- Email explains inspection was cancelled
- Calendar apps (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar) should automatically remove event

## Files Modified
- `/app/backend/server.py` - Enhanced cancel inspection endpoint (lines 979-1085)
- `/app/test_result.md` - Added task documentation

## Technical Details

**Inspection Data Structure:**
```python
{
  "id": "inspection_id",
  "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "property_address": "123 Main St",
  "scheduled_date": "2025-06-20",
  "scheduled_time": "10:00 AM",
  "inspector_name": "Brad Baker",  # Used for email mapping
  "agent_email": "agent@example.com",  # Optional
  "agent_name": "Agent Name"  # Optional
}
```

**Inspector Email Mapping:**
- Centralized in cancel endpoint
- Easy to add new inspectors
- Currently supports:
  - Brad Baker → bradbakertx@gmail.com
  - Blake Gray → TBD

## Status
✅ Backend fix implemented
✅ Backend restarted and running
✅ Frontend already has proper implementation
✅ test_result.md updated
⏳ Ready for user testing and verification

## Next Steps (If Blake Gray Email Needed)
To add Blake Gray's email when available:
1. Update inspector_emails mapping in server.py (line ~1040)
2. Change `"Blake Gray": None` to `"Blake Gray": "blake@example.com"`
3. Restart backend
