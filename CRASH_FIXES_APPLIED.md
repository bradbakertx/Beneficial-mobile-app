# App Crash Fixes Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing babel.config.js (MOST LIKELY CRASH CAUSE)
**Problem:** No `babel.config.js` file existed in the frontend directory.
- `react-native-reanimated` (v3.17.5+) **REQUIRES** the Babel plugin to work
- Without this configuration, the app will crash on launch

**Fix Applied:**
Created `/app/frontend/babel.config.js` with:
```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
    ],
  };
};
```

### 2. ✅ Socket.IO Error Handling (DEFENSIVE)
**Problem:** Socket.IO initialization could throw uncaught errors and crash the app.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added try-catch blocks around Socket.IO connection initialization
- Added defensive check for missing backend URL
- Made Socket.IO failures non-blocking (warns instead of crashes)
- Added timeout configuration (10 seconds)
- Wrapped Socket.IO calls in AuthContext with try-catch

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/frontend/services/socket.service.ts`
- `/app/frontend/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

## Version Mismatches Detected

Your installed packages don't match Expo SDK 54 expectations:
```
Installed          Expected
-----------------------------------------
reanimated@3.17.5  → ~4.1.1
gesture-handler@2.24.0  → ~2.28.0
screens@4.11.1     → ~4.16.0
```

These mismatches can cause build and runtime issues.

## Next Steps for You

### 1. CLEAR ALL CACHES (CRITICAL)
Before rebuilding, you MUST clear all caches:

```bash
# On your Mac, in the frontend directory:
cd /path/to/your/project/frontend

# Clear Yarn cache
yarn cache clean

# Clear Metro bundler cache
rm -rf .metro-cache
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# Clear Expo cache
npx expo start --clear

# Optional: Clear watchman cache
watchman watch-del-all
```

### 2. REBUILD WITH EAS
After clearing caches:

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### 3. TEST ON YOUR PHONE
Install the new build and test.

### 4. IF STILL CRASHING
If the app still crashes after these fixes:

**Option A - Install adb for logs:**
```bash
# On Mac (with Homebrew):
brew install android-platform-tools

# Connect phone via USB, enable USB debugging
# Then run:
adb logcat | grep -i "react\|expo\|crash\|fatal"
```

**Option B - Add crash reporting:**
We can integrate Sentry or similar to capture crash logs automatically.

**Option C - Troubleshooting agent:**
I can call my troubleshooting specialist to do deeper analysis.

## Why These Fixes Should Work

1. **babel.config.js** - This is the #1 cause of React Native Reanimated crashes. The library literally cannot function without this configuration.

2. **Socket.IO defensive coding** - Prevents network/connection issues from crashing the app.

3. **Cache clearing** - Ensures Metro doesn't use old, incompatible cached code.

## Summary

The missing `babel.config.js` was almost certainly causing your crash. React Native Reanimated is a core dependency used by many navigation and animation libraries, and without proper Babel configuration, it will crash immediately on initialization.

Combined with the defensive Socket.IO error handling, these fixes should resolve the crash-on-launch issue.

**Try the new build after clearing caches and let me know the results!**
