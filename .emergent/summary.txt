The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing the application's build process and implementing a series of user-requested features. Initially, the core application, Beneficial Inspections, received foundational enhancements like Socket.IO integration, OTP-based password reset, Owner Dashboard improvements (swipeable utilities, agent search), and various UI/UX fixes (calendar, landing page, tab bar, fee naming, biometric login, onboarding overlay). A recurring and significant challenge throughout the trajectory was resolving persistent EAS build failures, stemming from local environment discrepancies (native / folders in a managed Expo app) and deep-seated dependency compatibility issues with React Native's Fabric architecture. The AI demonstrated iterative debugging, guiding the user through permission fixes and library updates, specifically , , and , which addressed C++ compilation errors. The current state is a successful build, but the app crashes on launch, indicating a runtime or initialization problem, with the AI now awaiting crash logs for further diagnosis.

The Beneficial Inspections app aims to provide a robust platform for managing property inspections with role-based access for Owners, Customers, and Agents. Key implemented features include an Inspector Calendar, dynamic inspector fetching, enhanced security with JWT, automated MongoDB backups, chat visibility, and an expanded manual inspection entry form. Recent development focused on real-time updates via Socket.IO, a comprehensive OTP-based Forgot Password flow, and a full app icon refresh. Significant UI/UX enhancements were made to the owner dashboard (swipeable utilities, agent search), calendar scrolling, customer landing page modals, Android tab bar sizing, fee naming consistency, and the introduction of biometric authentication. Additionally, a Start Here onboarding overlay for new customers was implemented, and the placement of the manual inspection entry was adjusted. The project also included extensive troubleshooting of EAS build failures, addressing  errors, permission issues, and dependency conflicts.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing critical build issues on the user's local Mac environment. Initially, the user encountered  errors during An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username due to the presence of native  and  folders in the managed Expo project, which the AI guided the user to remove and . Following this, a  C++ compilation failure occurred related to  (v3.17.5) using deprecated React Native Fabric APIs. The AI recommended updating  to , which the user performed, leading to version . During subsequent  attempts, the user faced  permission errors due to root-owned files in their npm cache, which the AI provided a  command to resolve.

After fixing the npm cache permissions, a new EAS build was attempted. While 's compilation issues were resolved, fresh C++ compilation errors appeared for  and , also related to deprecated Fabric APIs (, ). The AI advised updating these two libraries to their  versions.

The latest update from the user indicates that the build process **completed successfully** after applying the recommended library updates. However, the application now **flashes the splash screen and then closes**, signifying a crash-on-launch issue. The AI has provided  commands to capture crash logs and listed potential causes such as missing  in , issues with  environment variables in production, or Socket.IO initialization problems. The AI is currently awaiting the user's crash logs to proceed with diagnosing the runtime failure.
