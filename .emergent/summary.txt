The AI engineer has significantly developed the Beneficial Inspections application, transitioning it from an initial MVP to a more feature-rich product. Work began on Phase 4: Customer Time Slot Selection, successfully implementing backend endpoints for customer confirmation and decline. Subsequent efforts focused on a series of critical bug fixes and feature enhancements, primarily revolving around date/timezone consistency across owner and customer views, dynamic calendar invite details (including agent info), and UI/UX issues like navigation and button functionality. A major feature, the Pre-Inspection Agreement workflow, was implemented, encompassing PDF generation, digital signatures, and dynamic inspector details. Multiple iterations were required to fine-tune date handling, PDF formatting (font, checkboxes, alignment), and signature pad functionality, often involving detailed debugging and cross-platform adjustments. The AI demonstrated iterative development, requesting user feedback frequently, and addressing reported issues systematically.

The goal is a cross-platform React Native mobile app for Beneficial Inspections with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, supporting Owner/Inspector, Customer, and Agent roles. Key features include JWT authentication, push notifications for various events (quotes, schedules, chats), Square payment integration, S3 report viewing, and real-time WebSocket chat. The app prioritizes mobile UI/UX best practices and branding.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
*   **User Authentication**: JWT-based login/register.
*   **Dashboard**: Role-based (Owner/Customer) with accurate statistics for pending quotes/scheduling/active inspections.
*   **Quote Management**: Customers request quotes via a detailed form. Owners review, provide, and submit quotes. Customer can accept/decline quotes.
*   **Scheduling Workflow**:
    *   **Phase 1 (Quote Acceptance)**: Customer accepts/declines.
    *   **Phase 2 (Customer Scheduling Preferences)**: Customer inputs preferences.
    *   **Phase 3 (Owner Time Slot Offering)**: Owner offers specific time slots, selecting an inspector.
    *   **Phase 4 (Customer Time Slot Selection)**: Customer views offered slots, confirms a time, or declines (sending push notifications).
*   **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar for owners, automatic calendar invites (ICS) sent to customer, owner, and agent (if applicable) upon inspection confirmation/cancellation, with detailed notes.
*   **Pre-Inspection Agreement**: Customer signs a digital agreement, generating a PDF with dynamic inspector details, which is then emailed to all relevant parties.
*   **UI/UX Fixes**: Comprehensive date/timezone handling, correct navigation, functional cancel buttons on inspection cards, improved signature pad.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several issues related to the Pre-Inspection Agreement PDF generation and UI. Specifically, the last task was to fix the customer signature alignment in the generated PDF, which the user reported was still centered despite previous attempts to left-justify it. The AI applied a fix by explicitly using  and  with  in the  file to force the signature to be left-aligned. After applying this fix, the AI restarted both the backend and frontend services to ensure the changes are loaded and effective. The status is that the fix has been applied and services have been restarted, but the user has not yet confirmed if the alignment issue is resolved.
