The AI engineer's work involved several significant feature enhancements and bug fixes for the Beneficial Inspections application. Initially, the focus was on implementing an Inspector selection feature, including backend endpoints for fetching inspectors and updating inspection details with new assignments, coupled with push notifications and calendar event handling. Following this, the engineer integrated AWS S3 for storing pre-inspection agreement PDFs and enabling owners to upload multiple inspection reports, complete with progress indicators. A major effort was dedicated to refactoring the Inspections tab to separate active and finalized inspections (My Reports) and adding search functionality. The integration of Square payments was initiated, adding backend endpoints and frontend UI elements for Pay Now and conditional unlocking of reports. The most recent efforts centered on debugging a critical rendering issue with the native signature pad on Android, which persisted even after consulting a troubleshoot agent, indicating a complex state or routing context problem.

The Beneficial Inspections app is a cross-platform React Native mobile application with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, supporting Owner/Inspector, Customer, and Agent roles. Core features include JWT auth, push notifications, Square payments, S3 report/agreement viewing, and real-time WebSocket chat. The application prioritizes mobile UI/UX.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based login/register.
- **Dashboard**: Role-based (Owner/Customer/Agent) with quick actions and stats.
- **Quote Management**: Customer requests, Owner provides, Customer accepts.
- **Scheduling**: Owner offers slots; Customer confirms, with reschedule/double-booking prevention.
- **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar for owners; ICS invites for participants (including new inspector assignment).
- **Pre-Inspection Agreement**: Digital agreement with PDF generation, now stored in S3.
- **Chat System**: Robust backend for owner-customer and inspection-specific group chats. Frontend for conversation list and individual chat screens, with persistent history, optimistic UI, sender names, local timestamps, and new inspector chat history visibility.
- **Agent Integration**: Agents view relevant inspections, group chats, dedicated dashboard, and a flow to capture agent info post-agreement signing.
- **Edit Inspection Screen (Owner)**: Enhanced to load/save all inspection details, including , , , , , and now an **Inspector selection dropdown** with push notifications/calendar updates.
- **System Maintenance**: Consolidated to a single MongoDB, blocked new owner registrations.
- **Report Management**: Owner can upload multiple PDF reports to S3 with progress feedback, and finalize inspections.
- **Finalized Inspections**: A My Reports section in the Inspections tab to list finalized inspections with search functionality for Owner/Agent.
- **Square Payments**: Backend endpoints for payment processing. Frontend Pay Now button (customer only) to trigger payment, which then unlocks View/Download Reports for finalized inspections.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete customer dashboard: Full UI for View/Download Reports button functionality (displaying a list of uploaded reports and opening PDFs).
- Full implementation of sending emails with reports attached on inspection finalization (backend email service needs to verify attachment logic for multiple S3 files).
- Implement viewing inspection reports via  (frontend integration).
- Quote Initiator/Inspection Participants Tracking: Update backend data models and logic to track agent-initiated quotes and all participants for inspections and chats.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging a critical rendering issue with the native signature pad on the  screen, specifically when testing on the mobile preview (Android). The user reported a Render Error after signing and clicking Done.

The engineer had previously rewritten  to support native platforms using  and updated  to integrate this native pad. The problem arose when the  callback from the  caused a re-render, leading to an error on  related to .

After several attempts to fix this, including adjusting  handling and using , the issue persisted. The troubleshoot agent was invoked, confirming the problem stemmed from  being called in an inconsistent context during the re-render. The last action (Chat Message 464) was to continue debugging this, noting that the backend logs confirmed the agreement *was* successfully signed, indicating the issue is frontend-specific related to navigation or state after signature capture.
