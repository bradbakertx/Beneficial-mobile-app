The AI engineer was tasked with building a React Native mobile frontend for an existing FastAPI backend. Initial efforts involved setting up the Expo project, installing necessary packages (, , , ), and creating a base application structure including authentication (, , ) and main tab navigation (). Key challenges included correcting the backend API URL multiple times, adapting to the backend's inconsistent API parameter formats (query vs. JSON body) and naming conventions ( vs. ,  vs. ,  vs.  role). The engineer successfully implemented core owner dashboard functionalities: displaying pending quotes and inspection scheduling requests, setting quote prices, and scheduling inspections using custom calendar/time pickers. Branding was updated to Beneficial Inspections, and logos were integrated. The final task addressed was fixing back navigation within dashboard cards, changing  to .

<product_requirements>
The user requires a cross-platform React Native mobile app for their existing home inspection business, which currently has a FastAPI backend and MongoDB database. The app needs to support Customer, Agent, and Owner/Inspector roles, each with a dedicated dashboard. Core features include push notifications, quote requests and scheduling, payment processing via Square (backend handles credentials), report viewing (via S3, backend handles access), real-time chat (WebSocket), and integrated sign-in/up. The mobile app must connect to the provided backend API URL, handle JWT authentication (token stored in AsyncStorage), and strictly adhere to mobile UI/UX best practices (thumb-friendly, responsive, accessible, etc.). Branding was updated to Beneficial Inspections with specific logo integration. Implemented owner dashboard features include viewing and responding to pending quotes, managing inspection scheduling, and viewing active inspections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing an issue where the back navigation buttons within the owner dashboard cards (, , ) were not functioning as expected. The previous implementation used . The AI identified that this might be causing issues with navigation stack management.

The current work involved modifying the navigation logic in the relevant screens to use  instead of . This ensures that when a user clicks the back button from a detail screen (e.g., Quote Detail, Set Date & Time), they are explicitly directed back to the main tab dashboard, providing more predictable navigation. The changes were applied to:
-   
-   
-   
-   
-    (already navigated back to dashboard upon success, but general back buttons were affected)

The AI made several edits to replace  with  across these files, ensuring consistent navigation behavior.
