The AI engineer's work on the Beneficial Inspections application involved a multi-faceted approach, balancing new feature development with critical build and deployment challenges. Significant progress was made on an Agent workflow redesign, including a new client info form and visual differentiation for agent-submitted quotes. A crucial Additional Emails for Reports feature was also integrated. A major portion of the trajectory focused on overcoming complex build issues for mobile applications, guiding the user through local environment setup, dependency resolution, Git synchronization, and correcting backend URL configuration. This involved repeated debugging of , , and build commands. Once core functionality and build pipelines were stabilized, the engineer began addressing a series of UI/UX improvements (time zones, placeholders, dropdowns, calendar display) and initiated real-time updates via Socket.IO, transitioning the app towards an instant, native-feeling experience.

<product_requirements>
The Beneficial Inspections app streamlines property inspections for Owners, Customers, and Agents. The core problem is managing inspections from quote to reporting with role-based access.

**Implemented features from previous cycle:**
- Inspector Calendar: 8 AM-4 PM display, specific blocks (8-10 AM, 11-1 PM, 2-4 PM).
- Dynamic Inspector Fetching for Offer Times.
- Enhanced Security: JWT, privacy compliance (consent on register/first login, data export/deletion).
- Automated MongoDB backups to S3 with email alerts.
- Chat Visibility: Auto-delete/hide chats for canceled/finalized inspections, correct unread counts.
- Manual Inspection Entry: Expanded form with all property/additional fields, calendar/time pickers.

**Current Feature Development (Agent Workflow Redesign):**
- Remove Already Got a Quote? button.
- Agent Request a Quote: Property and Additional sections only.
- Agent quotes appear as distinct orange cards on Owner's Pending Quotes.
- After Agent accepts a quote and schedules, a new form for Client (Customer) information is presented, which is then stored on the inspection.
- Pre-Inspection Agreement automatically opens for customer signature.

**New Feature Requests & Bug Fixes:**
- Add an optional Additional Emails for Reports field to Edit Inspection for Owners/Inspectors.
- Fix missing profile bubbles when chatting with Brad Baker for Owners.
- Fix time zone inconsistencies (lock to Central Time Zone).
- Add ghosted placeholder texts to the registration screen.
- Ensure dropdown menus show selections made.
- Rectify calendar display problems (stacking text/numbers, cut-off dates).
- Remove specific text from customer calendar invites.
- Implement instant push notifications and real-time updates.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing real-time updates using Socket.IO to provide instant notifications and data synchronization, addressing the user's desire for an app-like experience without manual refreshing.

The work involves:
1.  **Creating a  file ():** This new file encapsulates the Socket.IO client-side logic, including connection, event listeners, and emission functionalities.
2.  **Integrating Socket.IO into  ():** The  is responsible for managing user authentication state. The engineer modified this file to establish a Socket.IO connection automatically when a user successfully logs in. The objective is to ensure that real-time communication channels are opened as soon as a user authenticates, allowing for immediate reception of updates relevant to their role and activities within the application.
The current task focuses on adding the Socket.IO connection logic directly into the  function or a related  within  to ensure proper initiation and management of the real-time connection throughout the user's session.
