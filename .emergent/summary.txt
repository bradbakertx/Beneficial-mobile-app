The AI engineer has significantly enhanced the Beneficial Inspections application, progressing from foundational features to more complex workflows. Key achievements include refining the Pre-Inspection Agreement PDF generation (fixing signature alignment and integrating the company logo), implementing a comprehensive Reschedule feature for both owners and customers (including backend logic, new UI screens, and calendar updates), and adding a robust double-booking prevention system. Critical UI/UX improvements were made on login/register screens, ensuring responsiveness and clear branding, and a full-fledged chat system with role-specific conversations, message history, and push notifications has been built. The engineer demonstrates an iterative development approach, systematically addressing bugs, handling complex date/timezone issues, and constantly responding to user feedback, often requiring multiple adjustments to ensure a polished user experience. The immediate focus is on completing the chat system's frontend to display real-time conversations.

<product_requirements>
The Beneficial Inspections app is a cross-platform React Native mobile application with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, designed for Owner/Inspector, Customer, and Agent roles. It requires JWT authentication, push notifications for various events (quotes, schedules, chats), Square payment integration, S3 report viewing, and real-time WebSocket chat. The app emphasizes mobile UI/UX best practices and branding.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
*   **User Authentication**: JWT-based login/register. Login/Register UI refined for branding, sizing, and responsive layout, including a compliance footer on login.
*   **Dashboard**: Role-based (Owner/Customer) with accurate statistics.
*   **Quote Management**: Customer requests quotes; Owners provide/submit; Customer accepts/declines.
*   **Scheduling Workflow**: Owner offers time slots with inspector selection; Customer confirms/declines. Implemented a reschedule feature for both owner (calendar-based) and customer (call prompt). Double-booking prevention implemented with time normalization.
*   **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar for owners; automatic ICS invites for customer, owner, agent/inspector upon confirmation/cancellation/reschedule.
*   **Pre-Inspection Agreement**: Digital agreement with PDF generation, dynamic inspector details, and digital signatures. Agreement PDF now includes company logo and is free of duplicated text. Customer is automatically prompted to sign from Dashboard/Inspections tab.
*   **Chat System**: Backend models and endpoints are in place for owner-customer and inspector-customer chats with expiry logic and push notifications. Frontend conversation list and individual chat screens are being developed, with buttons wired up on relevant dashboards/cards.
*   **UI/UX Fixes**: Comprehensive date/timezone handling, correct navigation, functional cancel buttons on inspection cards (with custom modals), improved signature pad, customer phone number added to owner-side active inspection cards.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on enhancing the real-time chat system for the application. Specifically, the user reported that while text could be entered, clicking the send button resulted in nothing happens, implying the sent message was not appearing in the chat history area or the input field wasn't clearing.

The AI investigated this by:
1.  Checking the  function in .
2.  Reviewing backend logs, which confirmed that messages were successfully being sent via . This indicated the issue was frontend-specific, likely related to UI updates.
3.  The user also requested that the Chat with Inspector quick action on the customer dashboard should be a persistent conversation with the owner, displaying history, clearing the text field, making sent messages visible, and highlighting the bar if unread messages exist.

In response, the AI:
1.  Began modifying  to properly display conversation history by fetching messages and managing the  state.
2.  Encountered a backend error during this process:  in the backend models was missing the  attribute, which was causing issues, likely in the conversations endpoint during message processing or recipient lookup.
3.  Fixed this backend model issue by adding  to  in .

The current state is that the backend model has been updated to fix a dependency for the chat system. The frontend chat screen () is in a partial state of refactoring to implement conversation history, message visibility, and input clearing. The AI's last action in the trajectory was to restart the backend (after the model fix) and restart the frontend, then to continue updating the chat screen to prevent it from navigating back after sending a message.
