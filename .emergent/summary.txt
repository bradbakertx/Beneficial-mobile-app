The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a React Native Expo application for a home inspection business with a FastAPI backend. Initial tasks involved setting up the Expo project, configuring navigation with , and implementing core authentication and owner dashboard features. Key challenges included backend API inconsistencies, missing authentication endpoints, and frontend-backend data model mismatches, which were systematically addressed.

Significant progress was made on the owner dashboard, including displaying quotes, scheduling requests, and active inspections. The engineer implemented Google Calendar integration, a manual inspection entry form with comprehensive fields, and robust inspection cancellation, view, and edit functionalities. Throughout the process, issues related to navigation, UI responsiveness, and cross-platform compatibility (especially for logout and confirmation dialogs) were identified and fixed. Push notifications for owner events and email integration using Gmail were also added. The current work halted at an issue where changes made through the inspection edit screen were not reflecting on the active inspection cards due to a data synchronization mismatch between backend collections.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a cross-platform React Native mobile application for Beneficial Inspections, interacting with an existing FastAPI backend and MongoDB. It must support Owner/Inspector, Customer, and Agent roles. Key features include user authentication (JWT via ), push notifications for various events (new quotes, schedules, chats), payment processing (Square integration), report viewing (S3 integration), and real-time chat (WebSocket). The mobile app must adhere to strict UI/UX best practices. Branding is Beneficial Inspections with integrated logos. The owner dashboard requires viewing and responding to pending quotes, managing inspection scheduling, viewing/managing active inspections, and a Manual Inspection Entry form to create inspections directly. All data must be consistent across dashboards. Email notifications are to be sent from .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical issue where changes made to an inspection via the Edit Inspection screen () were not being reflected on the Active Inspections cards () after saving.

The console logs indicated that:
1.  The  endpoint was successfully receiving and saving the updated data to the  collection in the backend.
2.  The  frontend screen was showing a successful update message and navigating back to the active inspections list.
3.  However, the  screen was displaying outdated information for fields like  and  (e.g.,  was sent, but the displayed card still showed ).

The AI identified the root cause: the  cards primarily read data from the  collection, while the edit operation was updating the  collection. Crucially, only a *limited subset* of fields (like , Sun Oct 12 22:44:36 UTC 2025, ) were being synchronized between these two collections when an update occurred. Fields like  and  (which are derived from client_name/email in manual inspections) were *not* being updated in the  collection during the  operation, leading to the display inconsistency.

The last message states the intent to fix the backend to properly sync all the data between the  and  collections during an update.

<optional_next_step>
Update the backend  endpoint to ensure all relevant fields are synchronized from  to the corresponding  record.
