The previous AI engineer initiated a React Native Expo application with a FastAPI backend for Beneficial Inspections. The initial challenge involved resolving a critical data synchronization issue where edits to  were not fully reflecting on  cards. This was fixed by updating the backend PATCH endpoint in  and  to ensure comprehensive data syncing.

Subsequent work focused on refining existing features and building out the customer-facing workflow. Key areas addressed included Google Calendar integration (fixing 500 errors, credential issues, and responsive display), implementing a detailed customer quote request form, and developing a multi-phase scheduling workflow for customers and owners. Throughout this, UI/UX issues like logout confirmation modals, duplicate display elements, and incorrect dashboard counts were resolved. The AI consistently used  for confirmation, broke down complex tasks into phases, and debugged backend and frontend issues, often involving schema mismatches, import errors, and UI rendering logic. The current work halted at the beginning of Phase 4: Customer Time Slot Selection, creating the initial frontend screen and planning backend endpoints.

The goal is a cross-platform React Native mobile app for Beneficial Inspections, using FastAPI and MongoDB, supporting Owner/Inspector, Customer, and Agent roles. Core features include JWT authentication, push notifications (new quotes, schedules, chats), Square payment integration, S3 report viewing, and real-time WebSocket chat. The app prioritizes mobile UI/UX best practices and Beneficial Inspections branding.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
*   **User Authentication**: JWT-based login/register with  for .
*   **Owner Dashboard**: Displays pending quotes, scheduling requests, and active inspections. Includes Google Calendar integration (now responsive and showing errors gracefully), and a Manual Inspection Entry form for direct inspection creation.
*   **Quote Management**: Customers can request quotes via a detailed form. Owners receive push notifications, view pending quotes, provide a quote amount, and submit it back.
*   **Inspection Management**: Owners can schedule inspections (set date/time), view details, edit details (data sync fixed), and cancel inspections.
*   **Scheduling Workflow**:
    *   **Phase 1 (Quote Acceptance)**: Customer can accept or decline quoted prices. Accepting proceeds to scheduling, declining deletes the request.
    *   **Phase 2 (Customer Scheduling Preferences)**: Customer fills out a scheduling form (option period via calendar, preferred days of week, unsure option). Submits to owner.
    *   **Phase 3 (Owner Time Slot Offering)**: Owner views customer preferences, offers specific time slots (8am, 11am, 2pm) via a calendar, and submits offers. Push notifications sent to customers.
*   **Dashboard & Navigation**: Role-based routing is in place. Dashboard statistics (pending quotes, pending scheduling, active inspections) are accurate, and cards move correctly through the workflow.
*   **UI/UX Fixes**: Addressed logout confirmation on web with a custom modal, fixed duplicate address display, corrected image paths, and ensured calendar responsiveness.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was starting **Phase 4: Customer Time Slot Selection**. This phase involves building the customer-facing screen where they can view the time slots offered by the owner for a pending inspection and make a selection. The engineer has just successfully created the frontend file . The next planned step is to create the corresponding backend endpoints to handle a customer confirming a time slot or declining an inspection. This will involve updating existing backend models and implementing new API routes in .
