The previous AI engineer's trajectory primarily revolved around a protracted struggle with EAS build failures and application crashes on launch for the Beneficial Inspections app. Initial efforts involved addressing local environment issues like native / folders and npm cache permissions. The core technical challenge stemmed from deep dependency conflicts involving , , and , specifically with React Native's Fabric architecture and the New Architecture setting in Expo. The AI iteratively diagnosed and attempted fixes by: creating a missing , modifying  to disable , and trying various  versions (3.17.5, 4.1.3, 4.1.1, 3.15.0, 3.6.2), often encountering new C++ compilation or Babel plugin errors. Despite multiple attempts to resolve library incompatibilities and clear caches, a stable production build remains elusive, leading to the current state where the AI has proposed seeking expert help or reverting to Expo Go testing.

<product_requirements>
The Beneficial Inspections application is designed as a comprehensive platform for managing property inspections, supporting Owners, Customers, and Agents with role-based access. Core features include an Inspector Calendar, dynamic inspector fetching, secure JWT authentication, automated MongoDB backups, chat functionality, and an expanded manual inspection entry form. Recent development introduced real-time updates via Socket.IO, an OTP-based Forgot Password flow with new screens, and an updated app icon. Significant UI/UX improvements target the owner dashboard (swipeable utilities, agent search), enhanced calendar scrolling, fixed customer landing page modals, adjusted Android tab bar sizing, standardized Fee Amount naming, and integrated biometric authentication. A Start Here onboarding overlay for new customers and a refined placement for manual inspection entry were also added. A major focus has been resolving persistent EAS build failures, including  errors, permission issues, and critical dependency conflicts.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was deep in a critical debugging loop concerning EAS production build failures for the frontend. The initial app crash on launch (after a successful build) was diagnosed by the troubleshoot agent as  in . The AI successfully disabled this setting by changing  to  in .

However, disabling New Architecture led to new compatibility issues, specifically with  and  (versions 4.x), both of which require New Architecture. The AI tried uninstalling , which then caused 's plugin to fail due to a missing dependency. Reinstalling  brought back the New Architecture requirement conflict.

Multiple attempts were made to find a compatible  version (trying 3.17.5, 4.1.3, 4.1.1, 3.15.0, 3.6.2). Each attempt resulted in either C++ compilation errors () or new Babel plugin errors () related to 's integration. The user expressed frustration, noting the introduction of  complications.

The  file was created with the  entry, and defensive coding (try-catch) was added to  and .

The current state is that despite fixing the  issue, a compatible and compilable  version remains elusive, preventing successful EAS builds for a functional application. The AI has now offered the user options to either bring in professional expertise, verify on Expo Go, or consider removing .
